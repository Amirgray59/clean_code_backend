# ADR-001: Domain-Centric Design for Inventory Updates

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The inventory update logic (Gilded Rose kata) contained deeply nested conditionals,
making behavior hard to reason about, test, and extend.
The system is expected to evolve with new item types and rules.

## Decision
We refactored the logic into a domain-centric design with:
- Explicit domain rules represented as small, intention-revealing functions
- Centralized handling of expiration behavior
- Clear invariants for special items (e.g. Sulfuras)
- No dependency from domain logic to delivery mechanisms (API/HTTP)

No dispatch table was introduced to keep the rule flow explicit and readable.

## Consequences
- Improved readability and maintainability
- Each rule is independently testable
- New item types can be added with minimal risk
- The domain remains framework-agnostic and reusable
